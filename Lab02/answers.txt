Q:
If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

A:
Yes. This is called constructor overloading, which allows multiple ways of creating new DVD object.

Q:
When should accessor methods be used?

A:
- When returning an object as an interface reference, providing isolation from implementation changes.
- In procedural boundary layer classes for generic and flexible interactions.
- In boundary APIs (e.g., JDBC) due to unpredictable usage requirements.
- When object usage is known and predictable, avoiding unnecessary flexibility.
